# Source Data

The following report analyzes tax parcel data from Syracuse, New York (USA).

View the "Data Dictionary" here: 
[**Syracuse City Tax Parcel Data**](http://data.syrgov.net/datasets/1b346804e1364a5eb85ccb53302e3c91_0)

<br>
<br>

# Importing the Data

The following code imports the Syracuse, NY tax parcel data using a URL.

```{r cache = TRUE}

url <- paste0("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DS4PS/Data",
              "-Science-Class/master/DATA/syr_parcels.csv")

dat <- read.csv(url, 
                strings = FALSE)

```

<br>
<br>

# Previewing the Data

There are several exploratory functions to better understand our new dataset.

We can inspect the first 5 rows of these data using function `head()`.

<br>

```{r}

head(dat, 5)              # Preview a dataset with 'head()'

```

<br>

### Listing All Variables

Functions `names()` or `colnames()` will print all variable names in a dataset.

<br>

```{r}

names(dat)                # List all variables with 'names()'

```

<br>

### Previewing Specific Variables

We can also inspect the values of a variable by extracting it with `$`.

The extracted variable is called a "vector".

<br>

```{r}

head(dat$owner, 10)       # Preview a variable, or "vector"

```

<br>

### Listing Unique Values

Function `unique()` helps us determine what values exist in a variable.

<br>

```{r}

unique(dat$land_use)      # Print all possible values with 'unique()'

```

<br>

### Examining Data Structure

Function `str()` provides an overview of total rows and columns (dimensions), 
variable classes, and a preview of values.

<br>

```{r}

str(object = dat,
    vec.len = 2)          # Examine data structure with 'str()'

```

<br>
<br>

## Recommended Functions

You may use any of the following functions for this assignment.

<br>

```{r eval = FALSE}

names(), colnames()     # Variable names

head()                  # Preview data; defaults to 6 rows

length()                # Count of total elements in vector

dim(), nrow(), ncol()   # Dataset dimensions

sum()                   # Sum numeric values or total 'TRUE' values

mean()                  # Average numeric values or find proportions of 'TRUE' values

summary()               # Summarize variables, whether numeric, logical, or character

table()                 # Tally total occurrences of each unique value in a vector or variable

```

<br>
<br>

## Tips & Tricks

The following tips and tricks are essential to understand in order to complete this assignment.

<br>

#### Extracting Variables

Reference variables in R by using the **dataset name** and **variable name**, separated by the `$` operator.

```{r eval = FALSE}

summary(dat$acres)      # Extract variable 'acres' from dataset 'dat'

```

<br>

#### Adding Up Values

Use function `sum()` with a numeric vector to return the sum of all of its values. 

```{r eval = TRUE}

sum(c(10, 20, 5))       # Add up values 10, 20, and 5

sum(dat$sqft)           # Add up variable 'sqft' from dataset 'dat'

```

<br>

#### Adding Up True Values

Function `sum()` with logical values, i.e. `TRUE` and `FALSE` values, will add up all instances of `TRUE`.

```{r eval = TRUE}

x <- c(TRUE, TRUE, 
       FALSE, FALSE, 
       FALSE, FALSE)    # Creating a vector of logical values: 'x'

sum(x)                  # Determining the total 'TRUE' values

```

<br>

#### Proportions of True Values

Function `mean()` with logical values will provide the total proportion of `TRUE` values.

```{r eval = TRUE}

x <- c(TRUE, TRUE, 
       FALSE, FALSE, 
       FALSE, FALSE)    # Creating a vector of logical values: 'x'

mean(x)                 # Determining the proportion of 'TRUE' values

```

<br>

#### Sums & Proportions with Missing Values

R wants you to know if `sum()`, `mean()` etc. include missing or `NA` values.  

If a value is missing (`NA`), these functions will return `NA`.

```{r eval = TRUE}

y <- c(2, 3, NA, 5)     # Creating a vector with a missing ('NA') value: 'y'

sum(y)                  # Attempting to add up the values in 'y'

```

<br>

#### Allowing Calculations with Missing Values

Use argument `na.rm = TRUE` to allow functions to ignore missing (`NA`) values.

```{r eval = TRUE}

y <- c(2, 3, NA, 5)     # Creating a vector with a missing ('NA') value: 'y'

sum(y, na.rm = TRUE)    # Add up the values in 'y' while ignoring missing values

```

# How to Submit

Use the following instructions to submit your assignment, which may vary depending on your course's platform.

<br>

### Knitting to HTML

When you have completed your assignment, click the "Knit" button to render your `.RMD` file into a `.HTML` report.

<br>

### Special Instructions

Perform the following depending on your course's platform:

* **Canvas:** Upload both your `.RMD` and `.HTML` files to the appropriate link
* **Blackboard or iCollege:** Compress your `.RMD` and `.HTML` files in a `.ZIP` file and upload to the appropriate link

`.HTML` files are preferred but not allowed by all platforms.

<br>

### Before You Submit

Remember to ensure the following before submitting your assignment.

1. Name your files using this format: **Lab-##-LastName.rmd** and **Lab-##-LastName.html**
2. Show both the solution for your code and write out your answers in the body text 
3. Do not show excessive output; truncate your output, e.g. with function `head()`
4. Follow appropriate styling conventions, e.g. spaces after commas, etc.
5. Above all, ensure that your conventions are consistent

See [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) for examples of common conventions.

<br>
<br>

### Common Knitting Issues

`.RMD` files are knit into `.HTML` and other formats procedural, or line-by-line.

* An error in code when knitting will halt the process; error messages will tell you the specific line with the error
* Certain functions like `install.packages()` or `setwd()` are bound to cause errors in knitting 
* Altering a dataset or variable in one chunk will affect their use in all later chunks
* If an object is "not found", make sure it was created or loaded with `library()` in a previous chunk

**If All Else Fails:** If you cannot determine and fix the errors in a code chunk that's preventing you from knitting your document, add `eval = FALSE` inside the brackets of `{r}` at the beginning of a chunk to ensure that R does not attempt to evaluate it, that is: `{r eval = FALSE}`. This will prevent an erroneous chunk of code from halting the knitting process.
