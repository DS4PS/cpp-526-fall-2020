# Introduction

This lab provides the code to replicate the following [NYT Graphic](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/03/29/sports/baseball/Strikeouts-Are-Still-Soaring.html?_r=0&ref=baseball) using the core R `graphics` package.

# Lahman Data

These baseball data come from the `Lahman` package, which contains `Teams` - 
seasonal stats for each team.

<br>

```{r}

library(Lahman)
data(Teams)                               # Load 'Teams' dataset

```

<br>

## Previewing Teams Data

We can view the first few rows of `Teams` with function `head()`.

<br>

```{r}

head(Teams)

```

<br>

## Preprocessing

Summary statistics required for this graphic are calculated as follows. 

**Note:** *The years in the dataset exceed the years shown in the NYT graphic and require filtering or plotting limits.*

<br>

```{r}

ave.so <- Teams$SO / Teams$G                      # Calculating average strikeouts per game
year <- Teams$yearID                              # Extracting a vector of years per team

ave.so.min <- min(ave.so, na.rm = TRUE)
ave.so.max <- max(ave.so, na.rm = TRUE)           # Minimum and maximum x-axis limits

league.ave <- tapply(X = ave.so, 
                     INDEX = as.factor(year), 
                     FUN = "mean", 
                     na.rm = TRUE)                # Calculating league strikeout average/season

league.year <- as.numeric(names(league.ave))      # Ensuring years are numeric, not text

```

<br>
<br>

# Replication

The following recreates the NYT graphic as closely as possible.

**Note:** *You may replicate the graphic step-by-step or in a single code chunk.*

<br>

## 1. Average Strike-Outs by Year

The following establishes plot dimensions and specifies x- and y-axis variables. 

```{r}

plot.new()

plot.window(xlim = c(1900, 2012), 
            ylim = c(ave.so.min, 
                     ave.so.max))   # Specify dimensions

points(x = year, 
       y = ave.so)                  # Create scatterplot


```

<br>
<br>

## 2. Point Color, Size, & Shape

The following additional code builds on the previous plot to specify point color, size, and shape.

```{r}

plot.new()

plot.window(xlim = c(1900, 2012),   # Specify x-axis limits 
            ylim = c(ave.so.min, 
                     ave.so.max))   # Specify y-axis limits

points(x = year, 
       y = ave.so,
       col = "gray85",              # Color
       pch = 16,                    # Shape
       cex = 0.75)                  # Size


```

<br>
<br>

# Tips & Tricks

Consider the following tips for completing this assignment.

<br>

### Replication Checklist

Ensure you've performed the following to replicate the NYT graphic as closely as possible.

1. Limit years 1900 to 2012
2. Plot average strikeouts by team
3. Replicate x- and y-axes positions, labels
4. Add horizontal gridlines for each y-axis value
5. Add a title and subtitle
6. Include league average as blue line
7. Emphasize averages in 1924 and 2012
8. Annotate plot with historical events
9. Create league average legend

<br>

### Arguments, Arguments, Arguments!

Each function requires several arguments (modifications inside the `()`) to 
replicate the graphic. Remember to use `help()`.

<br>

```{r eval = FALSE}

help(mtext)

```

<br>
<br>

# How to Submit

Use the following instructions to submit your assignment, which may vary depending on your course's platform.

<br>

### Knitting to HTML

When you have completed your assignment, click the "Knit" button to render your `.RMD` file into a `.HTML` report.

<br>

### Special Instructions

Perform the following depending on your course's platform:

* **Canvas:** Upload both your `.RMD` and `.HTML` files to the appropriate link
* **Blackboard or iCollege:** Compress your `.RMD` and `.HTML` files in a `.ZIP` file and upload to the appropriate link

`.HTML` files are preferred but not allowed by all platforms.

<br>

### Before You Submit

Remember to ensure the following before submitting your assignment.

1. Name your files using this format: **Lab-##-LastName.rmd** and **Lab-##-LastName.html**
2. Show both the solution for your code and write out your answers in the body text 
3. Do not show excessive output; truncate your output, e.g. with function `head()`
4. Follow appropriate styling conventions, e.g. spaces after commas, etc.
5. Above all, ensure that your conventions are consistent

See [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) for examples of common conventions.

<br>
<br>

### Common Knitting Issues

`.RMD` files are knit into `.HTML` and other formats procedural, or line-by-line.

* An error in code when knitting will halt the process; error messages will tell you the specific line with the error
* Certain functions like `install.packages()` or `setwd()` are bound to cause errors in knitting 
* Altering a dataset or variable in one chunk will affect their use in all later chunks
* If an object is "not found", make sure it was created or loaded with `library()` in a previous chunk

**If All Else Fails:** If you cannot determine and fix the errors in a code chunk that's preventing you from knitting your document, add `eval = FALSE` inside the brackets of `{r}` at the beginning of a chunk to ensure that R does not attempt to evaluate it, that is: `{r eval = FALSE}`. This will prevent an erroneous chunk of code from halting the knitting process.
